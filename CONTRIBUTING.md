## Coding Guidelines

### File Naming

- Use `kebab-case` for filenames and `.ts` extensions.
  
  **Examples:**
  - `metrics-manager.ts`
  - `category.enum.ts`

### Code Organization

- Group imports by type: built-in modules, external modules, and internal modules.
- Enums, Interfaces, and Classes should be in their own dedicated files.

### Comments and Documentation

- Use JSDoc-style comments for rich, contextual information about code elements.

### Naming Conventions

- Use `UpperCamelCase` for Class names, Enums, and Interfaces.
- Use `lowerCamelCase` for variables and method names.
- Prefix private instance variables with an `_underscore`.
- Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.

### Method Patterns

- Employ method chaining where applicable.
- Leverage getter methods for controlled access to instance variables.

### Testing

- Every new piece of code should have corresponding unit tests.
- All code must pass existing tests.

### Dependency Management

- Explicitly list all dependencies at the beginning of each file.
