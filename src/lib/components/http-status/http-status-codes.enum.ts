/**
 * @fileoverview `HttpStatusCodes` enum provides a comprehensive list of HTTP status codes.
 *
 * The enum is categorized as follows:
 * - 1XX: Informational Responses
 * - 2XX: Successful Responses
 * - 3XX: Redirection Messages
 * - 4XX: Client Errors
 * - 5XX: Server Errors
 *
 * Each member of the enum represents a specific HTTP status code,
 * which can be used to set the HTTP response status or to understand
 * the type of response received from an HTTP request.
 *
 * Note that not all HTTP status codes are standardized, and some are
 * specific to certain web services. Therefore, it's crucial to consult
 * the relevant documentation when working with non-standard status codes.
 *
 * Relevant documentation:
 * - https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-15
 * - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes
